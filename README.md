# heart_attack_survival

Code from a project to determine 1-year survival post-heart attack. I used a machine learning ensemble to predict death within a year of the heart attack event. This model improved on naive estimates by 3.5x. The data are from the Worcester Heart Attack Study and are proprietary so cannot be shared.
